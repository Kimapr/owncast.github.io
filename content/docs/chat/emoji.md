Your stream's chat can be customized with your own custom emoji. You can add as many as you'd like and they'll be available to use in chat.

## In the Admin

By visiting the chat custom emoji page in the admin located at `/admin/chat/emojis` you can add and remove images that are available to chat participants.

{{<versionsupport feature="Emoji management" version="0.1.0">}}

## Manual management

You can manage your custom emoji images in the `data/emoji` directory on your filesystem. Here's what you can do:

* Add multiple static and/or animated emoji image files at once
* Delete an entire set of emojis
* Rename all emoji files
* Back up your custom emojis by copying them to another folder

## Bundled emoji images

The images bundled with Owncast out of the box are freely licensed by different authors. See the [directory of emoji](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/tree/develop/static/img/emoji) for the respective licenses associated to each collection.
